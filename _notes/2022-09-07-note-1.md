I began to study the basic results about the moduli space of curves, aiming to discover the constructions and geometrical properties of moduli stacks and spaces of smooth curves and stable curves. The detailed information we refer [Reading program on moduli space of curves](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/2022/11/15/Reading-program-on-moduli-space-of-curves/).
Here is my notes: [Notes on moduli space of curves](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/my_notes/ModuliSpaceCurvesReadingNotes.pdf), update at 2023/03/27.
