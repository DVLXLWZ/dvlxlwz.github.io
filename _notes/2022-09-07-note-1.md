I began to study the basic results about the moduli space of curves, aiming to discover the constructions and geometrical properties of moduli stacks and spaces of smooth curves $M\_g$ and stable curves $\overline{M}\_g$. The detailed information we refer [Reading program on moduli space of curves](https://dvlxlwz.github.io//Blogs/2022-11-15-Reading-program-on-moduli-space-of-curves). Here is my notes: [Moduli space of algebraic curves](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/files/ModuliSpaceCurves.pdf), **finished at 2023/05/07**.
