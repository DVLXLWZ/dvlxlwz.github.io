We will first introduce the theory of good moduli space of Prof. Jarod Alper and his cooperators, more precisely, the first 6 sections in their paper[^1] (the more earier version since the results in the paper are too general which we will not use). Then we will introduce a very general moduli space in the 7th section in paper[^1], the good moduli space of objects in abelian categories which will give our a very general idea to construct the moduli space of semistable sheaves and Bridgeland stable complexes. Then we give some glimpse of K-stability and K-moduli which is also using Alper's theory.
