Here is my notes: [BirGeo23](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/my_notes/BirationalGeometry.pdf), update at 2023/03/07. Our main is to learn some basic theory in birational geometry, including Kollar/Mori's book and BCHM and the basic theory of moduli of higher dimensional varieties. Here is our plane: [Birational Geometry Reading Seminar](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/MyBlogs/2023/01/03/Birational-Geometry-Reading-Seminar/).
