>> **Brief**. Let $X$ be an irreducible projective variety and $f$ a morphism $X\to\mathbb{P}^n$. They give a new proof of the fact that the preimage of any linear variety of dimension $k\geq n + 1 âˆ’ \dim f(X)$ is connected, by using the Generalized Hodge Index Theorem and de Jong's altration theorem that hold in any characteristic. They also prove the connectedness Theorem of Fulton and Hansen as application of our main theorem.
