This is the basic theory of hypertoric varieties (or toric hyperk√§hler varieties) and its geometry, including their symplectic resolutions
via hyperplane arrangements and consider their cores. We also consider their universal Poisson structure and wall-crossing structures via the family-version of Mukai-flops.
