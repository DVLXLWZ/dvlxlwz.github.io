The theory of Varieties of Minimal Rational Tangents (VMRT) motivated from the proof of Hartshorne conjecture due to S. Mori. Then developed by Ngaiming Mok and Junmuk Hwang in 80s to 00s. Now this is a important area to discover the geometric properties of Fano varieties of Picard number $1$.

In this note we will first introduce the basic theory of rational curves, including the Chow scheme of rational components and their useful properties. Then we will construct the theory of VMRT and to show how to use VMRT to discover the geometric properties of Fano varieties of Picard number $1$. Need to add more informations.
