This is the basic theory of virtual fundamental class which is the fundation of the enumerative geometry, including the construction of virtual fundamental class and the localization formula over it.

**Here is my notes: [Virtual-Fundamental-Class](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/files/virtual-fundamental-class.pdf), finished at 2024-07-25**. More general and relative version of intrisic normal cone and virtual pullback, we refer [虚拟基本类](https://www.bananaspace.org/wiki/%E8%99%9A%E6%8B%9F%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E7%B1%BB)  for an introduction.

**Here is my note about DAG: [DAG](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/files/DAG-Glimpse.pdf) which we might use in the enumerative geometry, finished at 2024-06-19**.

**Here is my note about Gromov-Witten invariants and topological recursion relations: [TRR-GW](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/files/GW-theory-and-Topological-recursion-relation.pdf), (has been abandoned for now) 2024-09-30**.
