In this note we will introduce the basic theory of perverse sheaves, including constructible sheaves, perverse sheaves, nearby and vanishing cycles. Moreover we will also give a glimpse of $\mathscr D$-modules, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and mixed Hodge modules. Finally we will consider some applications of the theory, such as enumerative geometry and representation theory.
