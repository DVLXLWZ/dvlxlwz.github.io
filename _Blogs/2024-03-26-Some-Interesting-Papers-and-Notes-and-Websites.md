## 1. Notes and Books
### 1.1. Algebraic geometry

> - **Jarod Alper. [Notes on stacks and moduli](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~jarod/moduli.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A very detailed note about moduli space, providing a detailed introduction to the stack theory and its applications. This note including the basic theory of Deligne-Mumford stacks, algebraic stacks and the construction of moduli space of curves. Furthermore, this book introduce the theory of good moduli space and GIT theory.

> - **Mircea Mustaţă (notes taken by Takumi Murayama). [Topics in Algebraic Geometry II: Rationality of Algebraic Varieties](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~murayama/Rationality.pdf), see also the original notes: [Rationality of algebraic varieties](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~mmustata/lectures_rationality.html).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is to determine which varieties are rational, that is, birational to the projective space. Several important developments in the field have been motivated by this question. The main goal of the note is to describe two recent directions of study in this area. One approach goes back to Iskovskikh and Manin, who proved that smooth, $3$-dimensional quartic hypersurfaces are not rational. This relies on ideas and methods from higher-dimensional birational geometry. The second approach, based on recent work of Claire Voisin and many other people, relies on a systematic use of decomposition of the diagonal and invariants such as Chow groups, Brauer groups, etc. to prove irrationality. Both directions will give us motivation to introduce and discuss some important concepts and results in algebraic geometry.

> - **Bhargav Bhatt. [Abelian varieties](https://www.math.ias.edu/~bhatt/teaching/mat731f17/lectures.pdf), see also the [note](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~stevmatt/abelian_varieties.pdf) taken by Matt Stevenson.**
>
>> **Introduction**. The goal of the first half of this note is to introduce and study the basic structure theory of abelian varieties, as covered in (say) Mumford’s book. In the second half of the course, we shall discuss derived categories and the Fourier–Mukai transform, and give some geometric applications.

> - **Brian Conrad. [Abelian varieties](https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~conrad/249CS15Page/handouts/abvarnotes.pdf), notes typed by Tony Feng.**
>
>> **Introduction**. We will aim to hit the highlights of the theory: complex-analytic case, general algebraic theory over an arbitrary field, duality and endomorphism algebras, and special results over interesting fields (finite fields, local fields, global fields). We will discuss heights and prove the
Mordell–Weil theorem for an abelian variety over a global field.

> - **Brian Conrad. [Linear Algebraic Groups I](https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~conrad/252Page/handouts/alggroups.pdf), notes typed by Sam Lichtenstein, lectures and editing by Brian Conrad.**
>
>> **Introduction**. We will begin with an overview of the nature of the structure theory for various classical groups, with an emphasis on some examples and the remarkable properties of tori. We will then turn to a systematic development of basic generalities in the theory of smooth affine groups over an arbitrary field: group-theoretic constructions (matrix realizations, closed orbit lemma, commutator subgroups, normalizers, centralizers, Lie algebras, quotients), Jordan decomposition, structure of solvable groups (unipotent groups, diagonalizable groups, Lie-Kolchin theorem), and the solvable and unipotent radicals. The theory really takes off with the Borel fixed-point theorem concerning the action of a smooth connected (split) solvable group on a smooth quasi-projective variety. That will lead into the important conjugacy theorems (for maximal tori and Borel subgroups), which then takes us on the long road toward the structure theory of connected reductive groups (in terms of root systems), one of the real gems of pure mathematics. We will work through lots of examples, and begin to understand the special role of SL2 in the general theory of split reductive groups (to be developed in a sequel course).

>
>> **Introduction**. The aim of the note is to cover the structure theory of connected reductive groups over an arbitrary field $k$, including (relative) root systems, rational conjugacy theorems, and the Galois-action on Dynkin diagrams, illustrated with a variety of examples (both split and nonsplit). Some results need to be established over algebraically closed fields early in the course as a prelude to refinements over general fields. For $k = \mathbb{R}$ and $k = \mathbb{C}$ this illuminates the theory of semisimple Lie groups, for finite $k$ it clarifies the structure of finite groups of Lie type, and for $k$ a local or global field it leads to vast generalizations of classical results on the arithmetic of quadratic forms and central simple algebras over such fields.

> - **Brian Conrad. [Reductive Group Schemes](https://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/papers/luminysga3smf.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. We develop the relative theory of reductive group schemes, using dynamic techniques and algebraic spaces to streamline the original development in SGA3.

> - **Brian Conrad. [Alterations](https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~conrad/249BW17Page/handouts/alterations-notes.pdf), notes typed by Tony Feng and Aaron Landesman.**
>
>> **Introduction**. In 1994, Johan de Jong astonished the algebraic geometry world by proving a weakened form of resolution of singularities (using so-called “alterations” in the role of blow-ups) that works in arbitrary characteristic and is sufficient for most applications (even in characteristic $0$). Moreover, his method is so conceptual that it also applies over discrete valuation rings, giving a “semi-stable reduction theorem” for higher-dimensional varieties. These results immediately had many wonderful applications (such as Serre’s positivity conjecture in commutative algebra, and the potentially semistable property for Galois representations arising from the $p$-adic étale cohomology of varieties over $p$-adic fields). In addition to the pretty geometric ideas introduced by de Jong, his proof uses many important general concepts in algebraic geometry, such as the theory of stable reduction for curves, the étale topology, Artin approximation, algebraic stacks/spaces, Raynaud–Gruson flattening, resolution of singularities for abstract surfaces, and so on. So this topic is an ideal vehicle for seeing many important methods and results being used. In this note we will work through the proofs of de Jong’s main theorems over fields and along the way explain as much of the background.

> - **Brian Conrad. [Keel-Mori theorem via stacks](https://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/papers/coarsespace.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. This is the most general version of Keel-mori theorem about the existence of coarse moduli spaces. In this note, he use stacks instead of groupoids to give a streamlined proof of the Keel-Mori existence theorem for coarse moduli spaces (useless bonus: noetherian hypotheses eliminated).

> - **Brian Conrad. [Nagata's compactification theorem (via schemes)](https://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/papers/nagatafinal.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. We provide a proof of Nagata’s compactification theorem: any separated map of finite type between quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes (e.g., noetherian schemes) factors as an open immersion followed by a proper morphism. This is a detailed exposition of private notes of Deligne that translate
Nagata’s method into modern terms, and includes some applications of general interest in the theory of rational maps, such as refined versions of Chow’s Lemma and the elimination of indeterminacies in a rational map, as well as a blow-up characterization of when a proper morphism (to a rather general base scheme) is
birational.

> - **Ravi Vakil. [Introduction to intersection theory in algebraic geometry](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/245/).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A nice introduction of intersection theory developed by Fulton etc. This including chapter 1-6 and chapter 15 in the Fulton's book, including the basic construction and the theorem of Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch.

> - **Ravi Vakil. [The Rising Sea: Foundations Of Algebraic Geometry](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A standard and nice introduction of fundamental theory of algebraic geometry, including scheme theory and its cohomology.

> - **J.S. Milne. [Lie Algebras, Algebraic Groups, and Lie Groups](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LAG.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A breif and fast introduction of Lie Algebras and Algebraic Groups.

> - **J.S. Milne. [Lectures on Etale Cohomology](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LEC.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. In comparison with his book, the emphasis is on heuristic arguments rather than formal proofs and on varieties rather than schemes. The notes also discuss the proof of the Weil conjectures (Grothendieck and Deligne).

> - **Peter Scholze. [Algebraic Geometry I](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ja/alggeoI/notes.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. This note follows from a course which was taught in Bonn, Germany over the Wintersemester 2016/17, by Prof. Dr. Peter Scholze. This note including the basics of algebraic geometry, so about sheaves, schemes, $\mathscr{O}_X$-modules, affine/separated/proper morphisms, and eventually to show that proper normal curves over $k$ can be naturally associated to a type of field extension of $k$, and separated curves are quasi-projective.

> - **Peter Scholze. [Algebraic Geometry II](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ja/alggeoII/notes_II.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. This note follows from a course which was taught in Bonn, Germany over the Sommersemester 2017, by Prof. Dr. Peter Scholze. This note is started by looking at properties of flat maps between schemes, smooth, unramified, and étale morphisms, as well as the sheaf of Kähler differentials. Also sheaf cohomology in general will be introduced. After proving some technical statements about the cohomology of coherent sheaves, and various base change properites, we had all the fire-power we needed to state and prove the Riemann-Roch Theorem and Serre Duality. We wrapped up the course with the theory of formal functions, Zariski’s main theorem and Stein factorisation.

## Papers

> - **Diletta Martinelli, Juan Carlos Naranjo, Gian Pietro Pirola. [Connectedness Bertini Theorem via numerical equivalence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1978.pdf). Advances in Geometry, 2017.**
>
>> **Introduction**. Let $X$ be an irreducible projective variety and $f$ a morphism $X\to\mathbb{P}^n$. They give a new proof of the fact that the preimage of any linear variety of dimension $k\geq n + 1 − \dim f(X)$ is connected, by using the Generalized Hodge Index Theorem and de Jong's altration theorem that hold in any characteristic. They also prove the connectedness Theorem of Fulton and Hansen as application of our main theorem.

>
>> **Introduction**. We formulate a version of the integral Hodge conjecture for categories, prove the conjecture for two-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories which are suitably deformation equivalent to the derived category of a K3 or abelian surface, and use this to deduce cases of the usual integral Hodge conjecture for varieties. Along the way, we prove a version of the variational integral Hodge conjecture for families of two-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories, as well as a general smoothness result for relative moduli spaces of objects in such families. Our machinery also has applications to the structure of intermediate Jacobians, such as a criterion in terms of derived categories for when they split as a sum of Jacobians of curves.

> - **Alexander Perry. [Rationality does not specialize among terminal fourfolds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00951v1.pdf). Algebra & Number Theory, vol 11. 2017.**
>
>> **Introduction**. We show that rationality does not specialize in flat projective families of complex fourfolds with terminal singularities. This answers a question of Totaro, who established the analogous result in all dimensions greater than $4$.

> - **Lev A. Borisov, Andrei Căldăraru and Alexander Perry. [Intersections of two Grassmannians in $\mathbb{P}^9$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00534.pdf).  Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 2018.**
>
>> **Introduction**. We study the intersection of two copies of $\mathsf{Gr(2, 5)}$ embedded in $\mathbb{P}^9$, and the intersection of the two projectively dual Grassmannians in the dual projective space. These intersections are deformation equivalent, derived equivalent Calabi–Yau threefolds. We prove that generically they are not birational. As a consequence, we obtain a counterexample to the birational Torelli problem for Calabi–Yau threefolds. We also show that these threefolds give a new pair of varieties whose classes in the Grothendieck ring of varieties are not equal, but whose difference is annihilated by a power of the class of the affine line. Our proof of non-birationality involves a detailed study of the moduli stack of Calabi–Yau threefolds of the above type, which may be of independent interest.
