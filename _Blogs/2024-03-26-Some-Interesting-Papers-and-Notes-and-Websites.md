Here we will introduce some interesting papers and notes here. I may or may not read them.

## 1. Notes
### 1.1. Algebraic geometry

> - **Ravi Vakil. [The Rising Sea: Foundations Of Algebraic Geometry Notes](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/)
>
>> **Introduction**. A standard and nice introduction of fundamental theory of algebraic geometry, including scheme theory and its cohomology.

> - **J.S. Milne. [Lie Algebras, Algebraic Groups, and Lie Groups](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LAG.pdf)
>
>> **Introduction**. A breif and fast introduction of Lie Algebras and Algebraic Groups.

> - **J.S. Milne. [Lectures on Etale Cohomology](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LEC.pdf)
>
>> **Introduction**. In comparison with his book, the emphasis is on heuristic arguments rather than formal proofs and on varieties rather than schemes. The notes also discuss the proof of the Weil conjectures (Grothendieck and Deligne).




### 1.2. Other Areas

> - **Allen Hatcher. [Algebraic Topology](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT+.pdf)
>
>> **Introduction**. A graduate-level textbook on algebraic topology from a fairly classical point of view which including theory of fundamental groups, covering spaces, homology groups, cohomology groups and basic homotopy theory.

## Papers

> - **Diletta Martinelli, Juan Carlos Naranjo, Gian Pietro Pirola. [Connectedness Bertini Theorem via numerical equivalence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1978.pdf). Advances in Geometry, 2017.**
>
>> **Introduction**. Let $X$ be an irreducible projective variety and $f$ a morphism $X\to\mathbb{P}^n$. They give a new proof of the fact that the preimage of any linear variety of dimension $k\geq n + 1 âˆ’ \dim f(X)$ is connected, by using the Generalized Hodge Index Theorem and de Jong's altration theorem that hold in any characteristic. They also prove the connectedness Theorem of Fulton and Hansen as application of our main theorem.

## Websites

> - **[Stacks Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/)**
>
>> **Introduction**. The Stacks project is an ever growing open source textbook and reference work on algebraic stacks and the algebraic geometry needed to define them.
