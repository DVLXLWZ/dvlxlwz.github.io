## 1. Notes and Books
### 1.1. Algebraic geometry

> - **Jarod Alper. [Notes on stacks and moduli](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~jarod/moduli.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A very detailed note about moduli space, providing a detailed introduction to the stack theory and its applications. This note including the basic theory of Deligne-Mumford stacks, algebraic stacks and the construction of moduli space of curves. Furthermore, this book introduce the theory of good moduli space and GIT theory.


> - **Ravi Vakil. [Introduction to intersection theory in algebraic geometry](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/245/).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A nice introduction of intersection theory developed by Fulton etc. This including chapter 1-6 and chapter 15 in the Fulton's book, including the basic construction and the theorem of Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch.

> - **Ravi Vakil. [The Rising Sea: Foundations Of Algebraic Geometry](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A standard and nice introduction of fundamental theory of algebraic geometry, including scheme theory and its cohomology.

> - **J.S. Milne. [Lie Algebras, Algebraic Groups, and Lie Groups](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LAG.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A breif and fast introduction of Lie Algebras and Algebraic Groups.

> - **J.S. Milne. [Lectures on Etale Cohomology](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/LEC.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. In comparison with his book, the emphasis is on heuristic arguments rather than formal proofs and on varieties rather than schemes. The notes also discuss the proof of the Weil conjectures (Grothendieck and Deligne).

> - **Peter Scholze. [Algebraic Geometry I](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ja/alggeoI/notes.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. This note follows from a course which was taught in Bonn, Germany over the Wintersemester 2016/17, by Prof. Dr. Peter Scholze. This note including the basics of algebraic geometry, so about sheaves, schemes, $\mathscr{O}_X$-modules, affine/separated/proper morphisms, and eventually to show that proper normal curves over $k$ can be naturally associated to a type of field extension of $k$, and separated curves are quasi-projective.

> - **Peter Scholze. [Algebraic Geometry II](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/ja/alggeoII/notes_II.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. This note follows from a course which was taught in Bonn, Germany over the Sommersemester 2017, by Prof. Dr. Peter Scholze. This note is started by looking at properties of flat maps between schemes, smooth, unramified, and étale morphisms, as well as the sheaf of Kähler differentials. Also sheaf cohomology in general will be introduced. After proving some technical statements about the cohomology of coherent sheaves, and various base change properites, we had all the fire-power we needed to state and prove the Riemann-Roch Theorem and Serre Duality. We wrapped up the course with the theory of formal functions, Zariski’s main theorem and Stein factorisation.




### 1.2. Other Areas

> - **Allen Hatcher. [Algebraic Topology](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT+.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. A graduate-level textbook on algebraic topology from a fairly classical point of view which including theory of fundamental groups, covering spaces, homology groups, cohomology groups and basic homotopy theory.

> - **Haynes Miller. [Lectures on Algebraic Topology](https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/lectures-905-906.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. This is a note for a course in MIT (18.905 and 18.906). Topics include: Singular homology, CW complexes, Homological algebra, Cohomology, Poincare duality, basic homotopy theory, obstruction theory, classifying spaces, spectral sequences, characteristic classes and Steenrod operations.

> - **李文威. [代数学方法：卷一, 基础架构](https://www.wwli.asia/downloads/books/Al-jabr-1.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. 介绍基本的代数学基础的很好的书，详尽的介绍了基础的范畴理论还有代数学基础。

> - **李文威. [代数学方法：卷二, 线性代数](https://www.wwli.asia/downloads/books/Al-jabr-2.pdf).**
>
>> **Introduction**. 全面的介绍了同调代数的内容，比其他的书都要多出很多有趣的东西。


## Papers

> - **Diletta Martinelli, Juan Carlos Naranjo, Gian Pietro Pirola. [Connectedness Bertini Theorem via numerical equivalence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1978.pdf). Advances in Geometry, 2017.**
>
>> **Introduction**. Let $X$ be an irreducible projective variety and $f$ a morphism $X\to\mathbb{P}^n$. They give a new proof of the fact that the preimage of any linear variety of dimension $k\geq n + 1 − \dim f(X)$ is connected, by using the Generalized Hodge Index Theorem and de Jong's altration theorem that hold in any characteristic. They also prove the connectedness Theorem of Fulton and Hansen as application of our main theorem.

> - **[Stacks Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/).**
>
>> **Introduction**. The Stacks project is an ever growing open source textbook and reference work on algebraic stacks and the algebraic geometry needed to define them.

> - **[kerodon](https://kerodon.net/).**
>
>> **Introduction**. Kerodon is an online textbook on categorical homotopy theory, infinity categories and related mathematics.
