I'm now interested in the geometry of several varieties, moduli theories, derived geometry, enumerative geometry (such as Donaldson-Thomas theory, especially of CY $4$-folds) and related topics.

## Preprints in Arxiv

> - **1. Donaldson-Thomas invariants of special toric Calabi-Yau fourfolds and $[\mathbb C^4/\mathbb Z_r]$ via degeneration methods**.
>> In praperation.
