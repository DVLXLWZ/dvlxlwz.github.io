I'm now interested in the geometry of several varieties, moduli theories, enumerative geometry (such as Donaldson-Thomas theoy) and related topics.

## Works in progress
> + **1. DT-invariants of special toric CY $4$-folds and the crepant resolution conjecture of $[\mathbb C^4/\mathbb Z_r]$ via degeneration**. In praperation.

> + **2. Invariants of Quasimaps and GLSM via derived geometry**. In praperation.
