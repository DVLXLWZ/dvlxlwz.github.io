I'm a second-year graduate student from [Institute of Mathematics](http://www.math.ac.cn/) of [Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences]((http://english.amss.cas.cn/)) in Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. My Supervisor is [Prof. Baohua Fu](http://www.math.ac.cn/people/fbh/). 

I'm now interested in Fano varieties, rational curves on varieties, moduli spaces, enumerative geometry (Donaldson-Thomas theory of 4-folds) and related topics.
