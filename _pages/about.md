I am now a second-year graduate student from **Institute of Mathematics** of [Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences](http://english.amss.cas.cn/) in [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) in Beijing under the supervision of [Prof. Baohua Fu](http://www.math.ac.cn/people/fbh/) and [Prof. Yalong Cao](https://sites.google.com/site/yalongcaoshomepage/home). I got my bachelor degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) ([Taishan](https://www.tsxt.sdu.edu.cn)) in 2023.

I am now doing research on **algebraic geometry**, in particular I'm interested in the geometry of **moduli spaces, derived geometry, enumerative geometry** (such as **Donaldson-Thomas theory**) and related topics.
