I'm a first-year graduate student from [Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences](http://english.amss.cas.cn/) in [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) (see also [MCM](http://www.mcm.ac.cn/) or [Institute of Mathematics](http://www.math.ac.cn/)). My Supervisor is [Prof. Baohua Fu](http://www.math.ac.cn/people/fbh/). 

I'm now interested in Fano varieties, rational curves on varieties, moduli spaces and derived categories.
