I'm a first year graduate student from Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences in CAS (advisor: Baohua Fu). I'm interested in higher dimensional algebraic geometry, some special varieties, moduli space of varieties, coherent sheaves and derived categories of sheaves and their related enumerative geometry.
