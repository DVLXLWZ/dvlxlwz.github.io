I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [Taishan Collage](https://www.tsxt.sdu.edu.cn/) in [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I'm interested in higher dimensional algebraic geometry, birational geometry, some special varieties, moduli space of varieties and bundles and derived categories of sheaves.

I will begin my M.S. study at Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences in CAS in Sept. 2023.
